To integrate all payment modes that Flutterwave accepts, especially those that work in Rwanda, you'll need to support multiple payment channels. Here's a guide on how to do it:

Supported Payment Modes in Rwanda
In Rwanda, Flutterwave supports the following payment modes:

Card Payments: Visa, Mastercard, etc.

Mobile Money: Airtel, MTN

Bank Transfer: Not explicitly listed but can be supported through Flutterwave's bank transfer options.

Integration Steps
Setup Flutterwave Account and API Keys:

Ensure you have a Flutterwave account and API keys (public and secret).

Install Flutterwave SDK:

For a TypeScript project, you might not have an official SDK, so you'll interact directly with the Flutterwave API.

Implement Payment Logic:

Here's an example of how you might implement payment logic for different modes:

typescript
import axios from 'axios';

const flwPublicKey = 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY';
const flwSecretKey = 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY';
const flwBaseUrl = 'https://api.flutterwave.com/v3';

// Function to initiate payment
export const initiatePayment = async (payload: {
  tx_ref: string;
  amount: number;
  currency: string;
  paymentMethod: string; // e.g., card, mobilemoney, banktransfer
  customer: {
    email: string;
    phone_number: string;
  };
}) => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post(`${flwBaseUrl}/payments`, {
      tx_ref: payload.tx_ref,
      amount: payload.amount,
      currency: payload.currency,
      payment_options: payload.paymentMethod,
      customer: {
        email: payload.customer.email,
        phone_number: payload.customer.phone_number,
      },
    }, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${flwSecretKey}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
    });

    if (response.status === 200) {
      return response.data;
    } else {
      throw new Error('Failed to initiate payment');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error initiating payment:', error);
  }
};

// Example usage for different payment modes
const cardPayment = {
  tx_ref: Date.now().toString(),
  amount: 1000,
  currency: 'RWF',
  paymentMethod: 'card',
  customer: {
    email: 'customer@example.com',
    phone_number: '0781234567',
  },
};

const mobileMoneyPayment = {
  tx_ref: Date.now().toString(),
  amount: 1000,
  currency: 'RWF',
  paymentMethod: 'mobilemoney',
  customer: {
    email: 'customer@example.com',
    phone_number: '0781234567',
  },
};

initiatePayment(cardPayment).then((response) => console.log(response));
initiatePayment(mobileMoneyPayment).then((response) => console.log(response));
Handle Payment Response:

After initiating the payment, handle the response based on the payment method. For example, if it's a card payment, you might need to redirect the user to a payment page. For mobile money, you might need to handle the USSD code or link provided in the response.
